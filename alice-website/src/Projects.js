To solve this, my partner, Isabel Boufarah, and I used the OpenCV Python library to track swimmers and detect laps using a colored cap for identification. We began with recorded videos, later advancing to live-stream tracking with a user-friendly GUI.", tags: ['Python'], links: [{ icon: <FaGithub />, link: 'https://github.com/amao03/lap-counter' }] },

Using D3.js, I turned an SVG map of the WashU Danforth Campus into an interactive heat map that shows estimated student presence in each building based on the selected time and day.', tags: ['HTML', 'D3.js', 'Python', 'Figma'], links: [{ icon: <FaGithub />, link: 'https://github.com/j-g-sivamohan/Hackathon_fl_23' }] },

The watch then plays these haptics. These vibrations indicate whether a rower is working above, below, or at their necessary threshold.', tags: ['Swift', 'XCode'], links: [{ icon: <FaLink />, link: 'https://samfoxschool.washu.edu/collaborations/sensory-and-ambient-interfaces-lab' }] },
